Gender Bias is a topic that has a lot of views and debates. The presence of the bias is a result of centuries of social conditioning especially in India.
Today we have governments and companies and brands and many voices working to make a change and undo the past and create a path for the future for women but it is a journey and will need a fight towards and for it every day.

The problem starts in society itself and our age-old thinking and societal norms. And the stereotypes at the start of a girl’s life. We have practices in parts of our country which earlier used to kill the fetus at birth if it was a girl. But why? Girls are seen as liabilities while boys are seen as assets. Sad but true. So we don’t educate them, they do housework and menial jobs, as they grow up they do not have a voice, and then we marry off our girls early – making our girls not ready to manage themselves forget motherhood.
It’s a circle and cycle that has to be broken at many points of intervention. Across society we must educate families on it too.

Solutions to these problems have to be handled at 3 levels. One, at a level of government and institutions and another at a societal level in communities and families, communicating and providing for girls themselves and shaping their minds from a young age. Today the government is providing many solutions like delaying the age of marriage, providing for her education – girls get free education till grade 12. Dowry is illegal today. In all skills and career opportunities we are defining policies that force you to push the diversity agenda be it in the armed forces or companies or even at the grassroot level where we are supporting women collectives and women entrepreneurship in all ways.

The world has realized that is will only progress and grow if it has a diverse view on all things from all genders and voices of society. There are numerous sheforshe platforms. We are progressing towards a more equal world and when we do so we will be making a future for our girls.
